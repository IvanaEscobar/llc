### Postprocessing with the help of Jupyter installed on my local ICES Linux
### machine. **SVERDRUP** is mounted to my Linux machine (CABOT) to run any
### postprocessing steps. To mount to **SVERDRUP**, use sshfs (see CRIOS wiki 
### for details).
### 
### The postprocess steps are as follows:
### 
### * Login to CABOT
### * cd into the **SVERDRUP** mount: /workspace/<mount name>
### * Load Jupyter for postprocessing in the debugging stage
### * Prototype code in browser
### 
### Once I'm done prototyping the postprocess stage, I won't need to consider 
### using Jupyter, and this document will be null. 
### 
### NOTE: files to postprocess need to be accessible via the mount.
